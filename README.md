Recursion
=========

Personal projects to help me understand Clojure, my current favorite language.
Shout out to E. Wilson for turning me on to it.

In this repo you'll find
 * testing frameworks examples that accompany a presentation I did on 3 clojure test frameworks
 * random stuff most noteworthy are some project-euler problem solutions
 * katas - currently string calculator and yahtzee.

Feel free to clone and do whatever.

Cheers!
